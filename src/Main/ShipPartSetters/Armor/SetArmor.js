However, thicker plates are bulky and interfere with the maneuverability and handling of starships. Ablative armor grants a starship temporary Hull Points to each quadrant, usually distributed evenly. When a starship would take damage to its Hull Points, it first reduces its temporary Hull Points from ablative armor in that quadrant. Once a starship's temporary Hull Points in a quadrant are reduced to 0, any further damage to that quadrant not absorbed by shields is applied to the ship's Hull Points. The loss of temporary Hull Points does not count toward the starship's critical threshold, though for all other effects, any attack that reduces a starship's temporary Hull Points is treated as though it had dealt Hull Point damage to the target.";

      <AccordionText>
        <p>Armor protects a ship from direct-fire weapons (see Type on page 303, CRB), deflecting their energy and preventing damage to critical ship systems. It grants an armor bonus to a ship's AC. Armor's cost depends on the bonus it grants and the ship's size category. Armor is a passive system and does not require any PCU to remain functional. It provides protection primarily through mass, which can affect a ship's maneuverability (making it harder to turn) and make it easier for opponents using tracking weapons to lock on to the shipâ€” these effects are listed in the Special section below.</p>
