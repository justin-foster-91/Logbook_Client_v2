// Statikete: EMP Dispersal (Ex) "When a starship built with a statikete frame is hit with an EMP weapon, it reduces the duration of that weaponâ€™s effect by half, rounded down to a minimum of 0 rounds."
// Vermelith: Extreme Resistance (Ex) "An EMP weapon has half its normal duration against a vessel built using this frame. The vessel has a +1 bonus to its AC against direct fire weapons that use gravity and a +1 bonus to Piloting checks the pilot attempts due to gravity, such as escaping a tractor beam. In addition, a biomechanical ship built from this frame treats its radiation exposure as 1 level lower when determining critical damage effects due to radiation."
