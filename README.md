# Starfinder Logbook (v2)

This is a data tracking aid to the Starfinder tabletop RPG. The first iteration will allow users to add templated ship builds or their own custom build to their "hangar" page where they will be able to keep track of all the ships they have built or are using.

User logins will be coming soon.

The second iteration of this will allow users to track changes to their ships throughout the in-game combat. This will track damage to different components, what stations are manned, and all states of the ship that may change from one round to another.
