# Starfinder Logbook (v2)

This is a data tracking aid and ship builder for the Starfinder tabletop RPG. The first iteration will allow users to add templated ship builds or their own custom built ship to their "hangar" page where they will be able to keep track of all the ships they have made or are using.

The second phase of this app will allow users to track changes to their ships throughout in-game ship combat. This will track damage to different components, what stations are manned, and all states of the ship that may change from one round to another.


Note: The current development focus is on the "Custom Ship" section which can be reached through clicked the button on the landing page with that name.


## What this does

For anyone unfamiliar with Starfinder, this works the same way a computer builder app would work. Selecting a laptop or desktop has the same impact that selecting a ship's "base frame" would work, altering the constraints on the size of physical components that can fit inside. The available options in each section of the builder may change depending on options selected in earlier steps.
